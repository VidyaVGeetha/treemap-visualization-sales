# 🗂 Treemap Visualization – Sales Data Example

## 📌 Overview
This is a **mini data visualization project** focused on using **Treemaps** to display **hierarchical data**.  
The project was built as part of my learning journey in **data visualization** while preparing for entry-level **Data Analyst roles in Scotland, UK**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn how to **visualize hierarchical datasets** using **Treemaps**.  
- Practice using **Plotly Express** for interactive visualizations.  
- Highlight categories and subcategories in a **single compact chart**.  

---

## 📊 Dataset
A small **sales dataset** was used for demonstration:  

- **Category:** Electronics, Furniture, Clothing  
- **Subcategory:** Laptops, Smartphones, Tables, Chairs, etc.  
- **Sales Values:** Sample numbers for visualization  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Python** – scripting in Jupyter Notebook  
- **Pandas** – structured data in DataFrame  
- **Plotly Express** – interactive treemap visualization  
- **Hierarchical Visualization** – parent/child relationship (Category → Subcategory)  

---

## 📌 Key Visualization
- 🗂 **Treemap Chart** showing total sales distributed by:
  - **Category** (top level)  
  - **Subcategory** (drill-down level)  

Each rectangle’s **size** represents sales magnitude, while **colors** distinguish categories.

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/treemap-visualization-sales.git
2.Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas plotly
3.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
4.Run the notebook to generate the interactive Treemap.

📌 Project Highlight
This project emphasizes data visualization techniques rather than deep statistical analysis.
Treemaps provide a powerful way to show proportions in hierarchical data.
